                        <h2><br>How to Care and Clean Furniture for it to Last Long?</h3>
                        When it comes to furniture, there are a few key things you need to do to keep it looking its best. First, dust your furniture regularly with a soft, clean cloth. You can also use a vacuum with a soft brush attachment on low setting to remove any dust that’s hard to reach. <br>
                        Next, once or twice a month, you will want to give your furniture a more thorough cleaning. You can do this by mixing equal parts water and white vinegar in a spray bottle and lightly misting the surface of your furniture. Wipe it down with a clean, dry cloth afterwards. <br>
                        To protect your furniture from scratches and everyday wear and tear, consider investing in some felt pads for the feet of chairs and tables. You can find these at most hardware stores. Simply peel off the adhesive backing and stick them onto the bottoms of your furniture legs. <br>
